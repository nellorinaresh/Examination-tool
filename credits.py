"""
Credit-tracking for the Rs.20-per-examination model.

Takes a `db` object shaped like a real firebase_admin.firestore.Client
(specifically: db.collection(name).document(id) returning something with
.get() -> a snapshot with .exists / .to_dict(), and .update(dict)) — this
is exactly the real API (verified against the installed firebase_admin
package's DocumentReference.get/.update signatures), so the same code
works against a mock for testing here and the real client once wired up.

Firestore document shape assumed (licenses_examinationtool/{licenseKey}):
    licenseKey       (string, matches the document ID)
    active           (bool)
    expiryDate       (string, DD-MM-YYYY)
    creditsRemaining (int) -- NEW field this module adds

ASSUMPTION FLAGGED: "creditsRemaining" is a field name chosen to match the
existing camelCase style (licenseKey/expiryDate) — it doesn't exist yet in
the real collection and needs to be added (starting at 50) whenever a key
is created or topped up, e.g. via the Admin Dashboard.

Deliberately NOT using a Firestore transaction: a true transaction guards
against two simultaneous requests on the SAME license key double-spending
credits, but that's a rare race for this app's real usage pattern (one
court, one computer, sequential use) — a plain get-then-update is simpler
to reason about and test. Flagging this trade-off rather than silently
picking the more complex option.

    Small accepted trade-off: two simultaneous requests on the same
